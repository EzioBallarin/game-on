<h3 id="installationrequirements">Installation Requirements</h3>

<p>Make sure to talk to your web hosting service provider about these technical requirements, if you have any doubts.</p>

<h4 id="php">PHP</h4>

<p>Make sure that your hosting service supports and maintains a PHP version of <strong>at least</strong> <code>5.3</code>. Ideally, every service would have updated their PHP versions to <code>7.1</code>, but that isn&#8217;t a realistic assumption. If the most recent version is not an option, version <code>5.6</code> should do the trick.</p>

<p>In order of best scenario: <code>7.1</code> is better than <code>5.6</code>, which is better than <code>5.3</code>.</p>

<p>If your service does not provide a version of PHP greater than <code>5.3</code>, please be aware that there are potential compatibility issues due to the nature of the outdated software.</p>

<h4 id="wordpress">WordPress</h4>

<p>We highly recommend keeping your WordPress installation up to date. This not only ensures that you receive all official <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> security updates and hotfixes, but you&#8217;ll also receive the best experience when using GO.</p>
